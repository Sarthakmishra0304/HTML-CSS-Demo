- Adjusts:
  - navigation layout
  - image size
  - overall page structure

### 3. Animations
- `@keyframes fadeIn` used to create a smooth entry effect
- Helps improve visual flow and user experience

### 4. Box Shadow Effects

- Demonstrates how multiple shadows can coexist

### 5. Responsive Images
